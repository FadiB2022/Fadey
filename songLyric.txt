Leave The Door Open By Silk Sonic
What you doin'? Where you at?
Oh you got plans? Don't say that
I'm sippin' wine, in a robe
I look too good to be alone
My house clean, my pool warm
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin' romancin' in the East Wing and the West wing of this mansion what's happenin'?
I ain't playin no games every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna' lay in these arms, I'ma leave the door open
I'ma leave the door open girl
